# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my progress and implementations of various DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) in **JavaScript** as I follow a comprehensive course. The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey, demonstrate my understanding, and create a personal reference to revisit and improve upon over time.

## Course Overview

The course I'm following covers the fundamentals of DSA, providing a strong foundation in solving algorithmic problems efficiently. Topics include:

### Technical

- **Big O notation**: Understanding the time and space complexities of algorithms.

### Data Structures

- **Arrays**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
- **Linked Lists**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next.
- **Doubly Linked Lists**: A variation of linked lists where each node points to both the next and previous node.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Data structures based on the LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) principles.
- **Binary Trees**: A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.
- **Hash Tables**: A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookups.
- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges, representing relationships between data.

### Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
  - **Selection Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element.
  - **Insertion Sort**: A sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
  - **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the list and merges sorted sublists.
  - **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot.
- **Searching Algorithms**
  - **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores neighbors before going to the next level.
  - **Depth First Search (DFS)**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

### LeetCode Exercises

After learning each data structure, I will solve relevant LeetCode exercises to further solidify my understanding. These exercises will be pushed to this repository as I complete them, showcasing my progress and ability to apply what I've learned in practical problems.

## Progress

Each time I complete a new topic or section, I will push the corresponding code and notes to the repository.
